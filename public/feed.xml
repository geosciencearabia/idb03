      <description>Abstract: Choosing a representative element volume (REV) from finite cylindrical $μ$CT scans becomes ambiguous when a key field variable exhibits a slow axial trend, because estimated statistics can change systematically with subvolume size and position rather than converging under simple averaging. A practical workflow is presented to size an REV under such nonstationary conditions by first suppressing axial drift/trend to obtain a residual field suitable for second-order analysis, and then selecting the smallest analysis diameter for which low-wavenumber content stabilizes within a prescribed tolerance. The approach is demonstrated on \textit{Thalassinoides}-bearing rocks, whose branching, connected burrow networks impose heterogeneity on length scales comparable to typical laboratory core diameters, making imaging-based microstructural statistics and downstream digital-rock proxies highly sensitive to the chosen subvolume. From segmented data, a scalar ``burrowsity&apos;&apos; field--capturing burrow-related pore spaces and infills--is defined, and axial detrending (with optional normalization) is applied to mitigate acquisition drift and nonstationary trends. Representativeness is then posed as a diameter-convergence problem on nested inscribed cylinders: the two-point covariance and its isotropic spectral counterpart $\widehat{C}$ are estimated, and the smallest diameter at which the low-wavenumber plateau becomes stable is selected. Applied to a segmented \textit{Thalassinoides} core, the …&#10;Topics: Mathematics, Cylinder, Convergence (economics), Position (finance), Finite element method&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This paper addresses a critical industry gap: the absence of a standardized, comprehensive framework for integrating diverse drone-collected data into Digital Oilfield (DOF) infrastructures. A detailed, end-to-end workflow is presented to transform raw data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into actionable intelligence across onshore and offshore operations while maintaining alignment with industry standards and cybersecurity requirements. The proposed five-stage workflow covering data acquisition, pre-processing, data management and integration, analytics, and application enablement, combines established industry data standards such as WITSML, PRODML, and OSDU with modern drone technologies, cloud platforms, and advanced analytics. Each stage outlines technical specifications, best practices, and NIST-aligned cybersecurity measures to ensure reliability and data integrity across the enterprise. The framework mitigates integration risk through standardized data mapping and quality assurance, supports real-time fusion of multi-modal sensors (visual, thermal, LiDAR, and gas), and enables advanced DOF applications including predictive integrity, anomaly detection, and environmental compliance (methane LDAR). Key integration challenges ranging from cybersecurity and interoperability to data governance are addressed with best-in-class, standards-aligned solutions, enabling safe, secure, and efficient drone-to-DOF operations. Finally, A practical case from ADNOC, integr…&#10;Topics: Workflow, Interoperability, Drone, Cloud computing, Data governance&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study explores the use of machine learning to predict mechanical properties of subsurface rocks, such as indentation-based Elastic modulus, using input features from X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and gamma ray measurements. Traditional mechanical testing is costly, time-intensive, and often unfeasible for large datasets. Our goal is to develop a predictive tool that leverages accessible field and laboratory data to estimate geomechanical behavior, enabling real-time formation evaluation during drilling. By integrating in-situ measurements such as gamma ray logs while drilling and surface XRD/XRF analysis from cuttings, this approach supports live monitoring of the drilling process and improves on-site decision making without the need for routine lab-based mechanical testing. The dataset for this study was developed from direct experimental measurements on rock samples obtained during coring operations. All measurements were carried out in the laboratory: gamma ray signals were acquired through core scanning, mineralogical composition was determined using XRD, and elemental content was measured with XRF. Mechanical properties were then quantified through depth-resolved micro-indentation testing, ensuring that both geophysical and geochemical data were consistently tied to the same set of core samples. To evaluate predictive performance, we trained and validated multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boost…&#10;Topics: Coring, Support vector machine, Drilling, Geology, Data set&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Electromagnetic response is commonly computed in two languages: length-gauge molecular polarizabilities and velocity-gauge (Kubo) conductivities for periodic solids. We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs—transition dipoles and interaction kernels—from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via αfs. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing; interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films); and length–velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end. The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet—RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical f-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and operando interfacial diagnostics for integration into multiphysics digital …&#10;Topics: Dielectric, Materials science, Kubo formula, Polarizability, Polarization (electrochemistry)&#10;Venue: The Journal of Chemical Physics&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: CO2 injection has emerged as a pivotal technique in the petroleum industry, offering a cost-effective option to enhance oil recovery while contributing to improved environmental sustainability. The mass transfer of CO2 into reservoir fluids is the primary mechanism responsible for CO2 solubility trapping and enhancement of oil recovery. The minimum miscibility pressure between CO2 and crude oils controls the performance of any CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and storage project. This paper investigates the influence of reservoir conditions on the CO2-oil miscibility during CO2 injection in oil reservoirs. To do so, pendant drop tests were conducted, and CO2-oil interfacial tension (IFT) was measured at different pressures and two temperatures. The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) and first contact miscibility pressure (FCM) between the CO2 and crude oil were estimated from the measured IFT values by applying the vanishing interfacial tension (VIT) technique. The measured MMP was found to increase with reservoir temperature as MMP increased from 1175 psi at T=27°C to 2007 psi at T=70°C. Similarly, the FCM pressure was found to significantly increase with reservoir temperature. This research provides a valuable guide for screening oil reservoirs suitable for EOR and CO2 storage.&#10;Topics: Miscibility, Petroleum engineering, Enhanced oil recovery, Petroleum, Solubility&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Purpose. This study aims to improve mineral identification in porphyry hydrothermal alteration zones, particularly in the challenging terrain of the Gilgit area, by combining remote sensing data with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Methods. Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 1 imagery from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was processed using ENVI 5.3 software. Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) classification was applied to identify alteration minerals. The dataset was then augmented, normalized, and split into training (75%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets. A CNN model incorporating convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers was developed to perform binary classification of mineral compositions. Findings. Advanced CNN-based remote sensing techniques have demonstrated significant potential in mapping porphyry systems. The CNN model achieved over 90% classification accuracy for minerals like feldspar and chalcocite, based on their spectral properties and dominant color features. This approach is beneficial in challenging terrains like Gilgit, where traditio-nal methods can be difficult and expensive. Originality. This study demonstrates the successful integration of remote sensing data with CNN-based algorithms for accurate mineral classification, providing a novel approach to overcoming the limitations of conventional field-based methods in challenging terrains. Practical implications. The approach provides a practical and efficient solution for remote m…&#10;Topics: Remote sensing, Terrain, Identification (biology), Mineral exploration, Computer science&#10;Venue: Mining of Mineral Deposits&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via $(α_{\rm fs})$. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current.

      <description>Abstract: Illite plays a critical role in diagenetic processes of sedimentary rocks, influencing geochemical evolution, reservoir quality, and fluid flow pathways. This study experimentally investigated the hydrothermal transformation of kaolinite to illite using sandstones from the Upper Ordovician Quwarah Member of Qasim Formation, northwest Saudi Arabia. Experiments were performed to simulate burial diagenesis involving illitization using three fluid systems: a synthetic solution (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2), natural Red Sea water, and modified Red Sea water (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2 + Red Sea water) at different temperatures (80 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C). Analysis included thin-section petrography, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, whereas the elemental compositions of the experimental solutions were analyzed using ICP-MS and Ion Chromatography. At 80 °C and 150 °C, kaolinite underwent dissolution without significant mineralogical changes. At 200 °C, continued kaolinite disaggregation and dissolution produced smectite and mixed smectite–chlorite/illite layers, indicating early transformation pathways. At 250 °C, fluid chemistry exerted strong control on clay minerals. The synthetic solution formed smectite with minor chlorite and illite; Red Sea water favored well developed smectite; the modified Red Sea water promoted well-developed illite due to increased potassium availability. The experiments show illitization is strongly temperature dependent and primarily…&#10;Venue: Minerals&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The temperature dependence of most solid-state properties is dominated by lattice vibrations, but metals display notable purely electronic effects at low temperature, such as the linear specific heat and the linear entropy, that were derived by Sommerfeld for the non-interacting electron gas via the low-temperature expansion of Fermi-Dirac integrals. Here we treat temperature as a perturbation within density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). For finite temperature, we show how self-consistency screens the bare, temperature-induced density change obtained in the non-interacting picture: the inverse transpose of the electronic dielectric operator, that includes Adler-Wiser and a term related to the shift in Fermi level, links the self-consistent density response to the bare thermal density change. This approach is implemented in DFTK, and demonstrated by the computation of the second-order derivative of the free energy, and the first-order derivative of entropy for aluminum. Then, we examine the $T\!\to\!0$ limit. The finite temperature formalism contains divergences, that we cure using the Sommerfeld expansion to analyze metallic systems at 0 K. The electronic free energy is quadratic in $T$ provided the Fermi level is not at a Van Hove singularity of the density of states. If the latter happens, another temperature behavior might appear, depending on the type of Van Hove singularity, that we analyze. Our formulation applies to systems periodic in one, two, or three dimen…&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The characterization of carbonate subsurface reservoirs, which host significant natural resources such as water and hydrocarbon, is crucial for earth scientists and engineers. Key characterization methods include seismic and downhole sonic techniques. This study explores the relative influence of mineralogy versus pore geometry on acoustic velocity and velocity–porosity relationships in carbonate rocks, which is important for seismic and sonic interpretation in reservoir characterization. A global dataset from ten localities encompassing different carbonate lithologies—including limestones, fabric-preserving (FP) and non-fabric-preserving (NFP) dolostones, and siliceous carbonates—was analyzed using laboratory measurements and Differential Effective Medium (DEM) modeling. Results show that the mineralogy influence decreases with porosity, so it is limited only to tight rocks where dolostones show higher velocity than limestones while siliceous carbonates show the least velocity. As porosity increases, FP dolostones retain higher velocities, whereas NFP dolostones have comparable or lower velocities than limestones, contrary to expectations from mineral elastic properties. This behavior is mainly governed by pore geometry, as supported by petrographic analysis and DEM modeling. Siliceous carbonates display notably lower velocities, which is entirely attributed to smaller pore aspect ratios (about 50% less than in limestones) rather than mineralogical effects.

      <description>Abstract: Seismic phase picking is very often used for microseismic monitoring and subsurface imaging. Traditional manual processing is not feasible for either real-time applications or large arrays. Deep learning-based pickers trained on large earthquake catalogs offer an automated alternative. However, they are typically optimized for high signal-to-noise, long-duration networks and struggle with the challenges presented by microseismic datasets, which are purpose-built for limited time without previously detected seismicity. In this study, we demonstrate how a network-wide earthquake phase picker, the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), can be adapted to microseismic monitoring using transfer learning. Starting from a PhaseNO model pre-trained on more than 57,000 three-component earthquake and noise records, we fine-tune the model using only 200 labeled and noise seismograms from induced events in hydraulic-fracturing settings. The fine-tuned model thus preserves the rich spatio-temporal representation learned from abundant earthquake data, while adapting to the characteristics and labeling conventions of microseismic phases, which are often picked on peaks or troughs rather than onsets. We evaluate performance on three distinct real-world microseismic datasets with different network geometries and acquisition parameters. Compared to the original PhaseNO and a conventional workflow, the adapted model increases F1 score and accuracy by up to 30%, and strongly reduces systematic timing b…&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Barite is a widely used weighting material in water-based drilling muds (WBMs) due to its high specific gravity and cost-effectiveness. However, variations in barite particle size distribution (PSD) can significantly impact drilling fluid performance, influencing properties such as filtration, rheology, and formation damage. This study examines the influence of barite PSD on these key properties and explores the potential of perlite as an additive to enhance drilling fluid performance. To achieve this, three barite grades with distinct PSDs were prepared using sieving and ball milling. These were used to formulate three distinct drilling muds, which were then characterized and tested through laboratory analyses, including particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) filtration tests. The methodology aimed to evaluate the effects of PSD variations and perlite addition on filtration behavior, filter cake characteristics, and rheological properties. The results demonstrated that barite PSD significantly affects drilling fluid properties. Smaller barite particles enhanced mud stability and minimized filtration issues, whereas larger particles increased filter cake thickness and permeability, potentially leading to greater formation damage. Notably, the addition of perlite improved rheological stability, reduced filter cake thickness, and optimized overall fluid performance, with the most si…&#10;Venue: Journal of energy resources technology.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Effective removal of filter cakes is essential for restoring formation permeability and productivity, especially in open-hole completions. While hydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used to dissolve filter cakes, it may also introduce secondary formation damage, particularly through iron precipitation and pore plugging during fluid-rock interaction, in addition to the primary damage already caused by mud filtrate invasion and internal filter cake deposition during drilling. This study investigates the relative contributions of primary and secondary damage mechanisms associated with the removal of hematite-water-based filter cake in carbonate reservoirs using 10 wt% HCl under two operational strategies: squeeze and flowback. Core flooding experiments were conducted on Indiana limestone samples under downhole-representative conditions, and formation damage was evaluated through permeability, resistivity, CT imaging, and mechanical property measurements. Results indicated that primary damage alone caused up to 75% permeability reduction, while secondary damage developed during the removal stage, especially in the squeeze treatment where deeper acid invasion promoted iron precipitation in previously undisturbed zones, reducing far-zone permeability and increasing stiffness. In contrast, the flowback scenario improved permeability in the near-wellbore region and minimized secondary damage in the deeper zones, thereby preserving mechanical and petrophysical integrity.

      <description>Abstract: Summary Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using biosurfactants has gained significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness and environmental compatibility. In this study, we introduce a hybrid modeling approach that combines the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) with support vector regression (SVR) to predict rhamnolipid production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa MYSAG. In addition, we assess the produced biosurfactant for its potential application in microbial EOR (MEOR) using experimental data for model development, and benchmark the predictive performance of the hybrid BOA-SVR model against the conventional response surface methodology (RSM) using multiple statistical indicators. Compared with the RSM model, the proposed hybrid model exhibits superior predictive accuracy, achieving more than a 95% improvement in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), along with lower mean absolute error (MAE), relative error (RE), and root mean square error (RMSE), as well as a higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9833). We use additional simulated data to validate the hybrid BOA-SVR model’s generalization ability, and analyze the kinetics of bacterial growth and biosurfactant production using the logistic and Luedeking-Piret (LP) models, revealing a growth-associated production pattern. We further evaluate the efficacy of the produced biosurfactants in MEOR through interfacial tension (IFT) and zeta potential measurements. At a concentration of 0.27 wt%, the IFT decreases significantly …&#10;Topics: Enhanced oil recovery, Support vector machine, Coefficient of determination, Biomass (ecology), Benchmark (surveying)&#10;Venue: SPE Journal&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Accelerated soil carbonation (ASC) is a rapidly advancing carbon capture and storage technique which provides a dual benefit of permanent CO2 sequestration and geotechnical soil stabilization. This paper presents a comprehensive review of soil carbonation processes, emphasizing the mechanisms, quantification methods, and engineering performance improvements achieved through MgO and CaO-based binders and industrial by-products. The carbonation process transforms reactive oxides into stable carbonate minerals, enhancing soil strength, stiffness, and durability while reducing moisture content and porosity. A systematic analysis of the impact of carbonation on physical, chemical, mechanical, and microstructural behavior is presented, together with quantification approaches such as thermogravimetric analysis, calcimetry, and gas-balance techniques. The techno-economic evaluation highlights that optimized magnesia-lime-slag systems can offset up to 70 % of embodied emissions, offering a cost-effective and scalable pathway for carbon-negative ground improvement. Despite these advances, the field faces challenges related to reaction uniformity, long-term durability, and standardization of quantification and field protocols. The study identifies key research directions to establish ASC as a reliable, sustainable, and verifiable carbon sequestration strategy in geotechnical engineering.&#10;Venue: Carbon Capture Science &amp; Technology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Summary As global demand for energy is increasing, exploration and new discoveries of oil and gas reservoirs continue, with optimal field development becoming more critical. Field development planning requires a comprehensive understanding of the reservoir, which usually involves developing computer-based simulation models and using time-intensive optimization techniques. Recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI) indicates potential to support field development optimization (FDO). With this research, we investigate the application of generative AI in FDO by developing a transformer-based generative model for generating optimal future wells that maximize the net present value (NPV). A new transformer architecture is developed, and the corresponding model is trained and applied to generate two outputs: (i) a probability map, providing spatial scores that guide the optimization of well types and locations, and (ii) a well control map that specifies the optimal operating settings at each location. The architecture includes an encoder module, which captures complex patterns and dependencies within the numerical simulation data to support well placement decisions. It also includes an embedding layer that converts raw data into dense vectors and encoding layers that add spatial and temporal context to improve model understanding of reservoir dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using the PUNQ-S3 benchmark reservoir simulation model using various input scena…&#10;Venue: SPE Journal&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The photoelectric (PEF) log measures the photoelectric absorption factor, pivotal for determining rock matrix properties. High absorption factor values are typical in limestones, dolomites, clay, iron-bearing minerals, and heavy minerals, whereas sandstones exhibit lower values. In this study, actual photoelectric logs were gathered from the field alongside various other logs such as gallons per minute (GPM), standpipe pressure (SPP), rate of penetration (ROP), and bulk density (RHOB). Utilizing a suite of machine learning regression techniques—ridge regression, linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), polynomial regression, random forest, and decision tree—this research aimed to predict the photoelectric logs using porosity and other log data as inputs. The effectiveness of these models was confirmed through their strong predictive accuracy relative to actual log values. The ensemble of regression models demonstrated significant correlation coefficients and low root mean square errors, illustrating their robust capability to predict photoelectric data at various depths based on available drilling data.&#10;Venue: SPE Annual Caspian Technical Conference and Exhibition&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The performance of oil-based drilling fluids (OBDFs) is often compromised under high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions, where emulsion instability, barite sag, and rheological breakdown become critical concerns. This study investigates the use of Claytone-EM, a commercial organoclay (OC), as a rheological and stabilization additive to improve OBDF behavior in such challenging environments. Claytone-EM was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), particle size distribution (PSD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine its mineralogical and morphological attributes. The additive was incorporated into an HPHT-grade OBDF and compared to a conventional OC (MC-TONE) across multiple performance metrics, including electrical stability, sag resistance (both static and dynamic), rheology, and filtration behavior. Tests were conducted at 275°F and 500 psi to simulate downhole conditions. The Claytone-EM formulation exhibited enhanced electrical stability, reduced sag tendency under static and circulating conditions, and improved gel strength. Rheological measurements showed increased yield point and better flow behavior at low shear rates, supporting improved cuttings transport. In HPHT filtration tests, Claytone-EM contributed to lower fluid loss and thinner, more compact filter cakes. These results demonstrate that Claytone-EM can strengthen OBDF performance in HPHT wells by enhancing fluid structure, suspension stabili…&#10;Venue: SPE Annual Caspian Technical Conference and Exhibition&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Hydrogen blending with natural gas (H2-NG blending) is a practical way to reduce and address the carbon impact of using natural gas while offering a cost-effective way to transport huge amounts of H2. This study aims to evaluate the Riverland pipeline system located in Australia. The study provides information on how different H2 concentrations in the gas mixture affect the pipeline&apos;s erosional velocity ratio (EVR), corrosion rates, and pressure performance. The Riverland Transmission Pipeline was built to convey the gas travel though Angaston gate and compressor station to Berri gate station and later distribute the gas in Berri region. The Riverland Pipeline has a number of farm taps and the lateral pipeline joining the Riverland Pipeline at Sedan and the township of Murray Bridge. The pipeline is 314km long and have diameter of 114mm with an MAOP of 10,000kPa and capacity of 5.6 TJ/day. We took a novel technique and created a simulation model in PIPESIM-Net software that incorporates a GIS map to compute pressure drops, precisely record topographical profiles, and accurately imitate steady state gaseous flow. In addition to specifying nodes (sink/source) with suitable boundary conditions, it also considers aspects like pipeline specifications, elevation, and the gas composition. The results indicate that the corrosion rate increases slightly with increasing H2 concentration, reaching its highest at 80% H2 followed by decrease in corrosion rate at every 10% decreas…&#10;Venue: SPE Annual Caspian Technical Conference and Exhibition&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Urbanization and climate change are intensifying the co-occurrence of drought and surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects, yet their combined dynamics remain poorly understood at high spatial resolution. This study evaluates the compound risk of drought and UHI in South Korea&apos;s Saemangeum region using a hybrid KNN–LSTM model, alongside three comparative approaches (KNN, CNN, CNN–LSTM), incorporating CMIP6 climate projections and satellite-derived land metrics. The KNN–LSTM model demonstrated superior performance (R² = 0.94; MSE = 0.0053), accurately capturing an increasing drought–SUHI association, which rose from 0.84 (1991–2020) to 1.00 by 2100 under the SSP585 scenario. High-risk zones predominantly overlap with built-up and cropland areas, where UHI indices exceed 4.0 and drought probabilities surpass 0.9. Although land use explains over 80% of drought variability under baseline conditions, its predictive power diminishes under future warming, highlighting the growing role of climate feedbacks. These findings emphasize the emergence of synchronized thermal and hydrological stressors in urbanizing coastal regions and underscore the need for integrated land-climate adaptation strategies supported by machine learning-based early warning systems.&#10;Venue: Geocarto International&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: Luminescence dating of interdune sabkha sediments and cross strata deposited on the lee face of a 160-m-high mega-crescentic dune in the eastern Rub’ al-Khali sand sea provides information on dune dynamics and preservation potential. Optically stimulated luminescence ages show that the rates of dune accumulation varied during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene. Sedimentary structures indicate that megadune migration was the result of strong northwesterly “Shamal” winds. During the same interval of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, linear dunes in the northeastern United Arab Emirates were also accumulating rapidly, indicating that the period 16−9 ka was characterized by regionally widespread dune formation and/or reworking. The dune has subsequently migrated to the SSE almost 900 m since the early Holocene, at an average rate of 77 m/k.y., indicating persistence of the Shamal wind system for at least 20 k.y. Rates of megadune migration and wet sabkha accumulation reveal that, despite their very large size, less than 1% of the megadune would be preserved in a sedimentary record.&#10;Venue: Geology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The accelerating frequency and complexity of natural and anthropogenic disasters have necessitated the emergence of intelligent frameworks capable of transforming disaster management from reactive response to proactive governance. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted decision-making models have become integral to forecasting hazards, assessing risks, and coordinating emergency responses with precision and efficiency. This chapter presents a comprehensive examination of the conceptual, theoretical, and computational underpinnings of AI-driven decision-making in disaster forecasting, risk mitigation, and emergency response coordination. The discussion highlights the integration of machine learning, deep learning, and probabilistic models for multi-hazard prediction, spatial-temporal analysis, and real-time decision support. It explores the role of reinforcement learning in adaptive risk management, the use of simulation-based systems for preventive strategies, and the development of hybrid AI architectures that enhance policy responsiveness. By synthesizing global case studies, empirical findings, and computational frameworks, the chapter provides insights into the transformation of disaster governance through intelligent automation and predictive analytics. The research also identifies existing gaps and technological limitations, emphasizing the need for explainable, interoperable, and ethically aligned AI systems.

      <description>Abstract: To maximize production efficiency, natural gas flow via surface well chokes must be optimized. The nonlinear character of this flow frequently causes problems for conventional empirical correlations and mechanistic models. To accurately forecast gas flow rates using field data, this study develops an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that considers temperature, gas gravity, choke size, and pressures. The main innovation is that the optimized network is used to derive an exact, closed-form empirical equation, going beyond the typical &quot;black-box&quot; use of ANN. This equation enables the estimation of flow rate in real-time without requiring the execution of the ANN model, providing engineers with a valuable tool at present. The 5-neuron optimized ANN demonstrated remarkable accuracy, with training and testing average absolute percentage errors (AAPE) below 2% and a correlation coefficient (R) over 0.99. When tested on unknown data, the resultant equation performed well (R=0.999, AAPE=2.78%), outperforming conventional techniques in terms of generalization and predictive power. By connecting data-driven analytics with field operational realities for well management, this research represents a significant leap forward.&#10;Venue: International Journal of Petroleum Technology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Background Proximal femur fractures (PFFs) represent a major healthcare burden in the United Kingdom, with approximately 76,000 cases annually. Extra-capsular fractures are commonly treated with Dynamic Hip Screws (DHS), short or long intramedullary nails (IMNs), all of which require intraoperative fluoroscopy. Consequently, orthopaedic surgeons and patients are exposed to ionising radiation and the associated stochastic and deterministic risks. Despite regulations under the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2017 (IR(ME)R), a wide variation in radiation safety knowledge persists, and there are no established benchmarks for acceptable exposure. This audit aims to assess whether a departmental teaching programme could reduce radiation exposure during extra-capsular PFF fixation and to explore differences between consultant and trainee-led cases. Methodology This audit was conducted at Dorset County Hospital, United Kingdom, audit number 6323. Patients with closed extra-capsular PFFs managed using DHS, short or long IMN fixations were included. Radiation exposure, expressed as dose-area product (DAP), was recorded from the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) across two audit cycles: before and after delivery of an educational programme, emphasising radiological stewardship and safety. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-tests, with significance set at &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05 and effect sizes reported using Cohen&apos;s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;.

      <description>Abstract: We present an isothermal Global Buckley--Leverett framework for multicomponent, multiphase flow in porous and fractured media that retains the interpretability of classical Buckley--Leverett while incorporating essential physics: equation of state-based phase behavior, multicomponent Maxwell--Stefan diffusion, dynamic capillarity, stress-sensitive permeability, and non-Darcy fracture flow. The formulation yields a single global-pressure equation driving the total Darcy flux and an exact fractional-flow decomposition of phase velocities with buoyancy and capillary drifts; inertial effects enter as per-phase damping that renormalizes mobilities. Crucially, the combination of Maxwell--Stefan diffusion and dynamic capillarity renders transport pseudo-parabolic, resolving the loss of strict hyperbolicity that plagues three-phase Buckley--Leverett and ensuring a well-posed initial-value problem. In practice, each time step solves the scalar global-pressure equation, reconstructs phase fluxes via the split, and advances strictly conservative component balances; axisymmetric (cylindrical) forms for radial injection with vertical buoyancy are provided. The model reduces exactly to classical Buckley--Leverett when added physics are disabled, making it a practical backbone for carbon storage and contaminant transport in fractured, compositionally complex reservoirs.&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: A new oscillating catalytic reaction is discovered: steam reforming of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over Rh nanoparticles. The reducing products from the reforming reaction convert SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to adsorbed sulfur, which causes deactivation. When activity, and thus the reducing environment, is lost, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidizes adsorbed S back into gaseous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and activity re-emerges via a transient, S-free, but less active metastable state. Electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations show that adsorption of S drives a reconstruction of the particle edges, which is reversed when H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidizes away the sulfur. The reconstructions during S-adsorption alter the particle edges decorated by (211) steps into edges decorated with a (110) step. Our theoretical calculations reveal that the (211) configuration is an order of magnitude more active for reforming and identifies the reconstructed edges as the metastable state. The cycling between the presence and absence of the active (211) step sites thus leads to the discontinuity in activity that results in sustained oscillations. The correlation between activity and the presence of (211) step sites identifies these as the primary active sites for the industrially important catalytic reforming of methane. These results illustrate how heterogeneous catalysts can be extremely sensitive to the detailed configuration of the active site, such as steps with a certain structure.

      <description>Abstract: Acid fracturing is a stimulation technique that creates dissolution in the carbonate rock to enhance productivity; however, it could cause mechanical damage that accelerates fracture closure. Previous studies assessed diammonium phosphate (DAP) as a consolidating agent to maintain the fracture&apos;s cohesion after acid fracturing and enhance its stiffness. In this study, DAP compatibility with a reservoir rock and fracturing fluid additives has been broadly examined. Indiana limestone cores were used to evaluate DAP&apos;s effect on face permeability (regained permeability). Fully penetrating and creating partial wormholes using acid, followed by DAP treatment, was used to assess the changes in the fracture face permeability. It has been observed that using DAP did not lead to plugging of the created wormholes, as indicated by zero pressure drop across the sample. Nevertheless, a 49% regained permeability was measured in the sample with partial wormholes. The compatibility of broken gel systems of typical acid fracturing recipes with 1 M DAP was examined visually and using rheological tests, confirming no precipitation or damage. Indiana limestone and Austin chalk core plug samples were subjected to 1 M DAP alone and two separate mixtures: 1 M DAP with broken gel A and 1 M DAP with broken gel B for 72 h at 70 °C and 1,000 psi, showing no precipitate, color change, or rheological effects. DAP is found to stiffen the specimens and maintain gel integrity and does not plug the wormholes c…&#10;Venue: ACS Omega&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs has traditionally relied on water-based fluids, but this approach suffers from excessive water consumption and environmental challenges. CO2 foam fracturing fluids have emerged as a promising alternative, offering up to an 80% reduction in freshwater usage while improving proppant transport and formation cleanup. Therefore, this study develops a surfactant-stabilized CO2 foam system using seawater as the base fluid, aming to achieve high viscosity and stability of CO2 under high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) conditions. The study evaluated foam rheology with a customed HPHT foam rheometer at 150 °C and 1,000 psi to assess the durability of foam&apos;s viscosity, which indicates its stability. Novel surfactant formulation was tested with and without the addition of a gel stabilizer or a high-temperature (HT) stabilizer. The CO2 foam with the gel stabilizer achieved an initial viscosity of up to 55 cP at 100 /s shear rate, which was reduced by about 9% after 30 minutes and nearly18% after 60 minutes at 150 °C. These results indicate significant improvement of the thermal stability compared to the surfactant-only foam (which dropped to 35 cP in 60 minutes). The optimized foam also demonstrated compatibility with high-salinity brine and maintained viscosity at shear rates up to 1000 /s, suggesting effective proppant suspension capability. By using low concentrations (0.5 and 1 wt%) of surfactant and readily available stabi…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Drilling operations for oil and gas wells, constituting up to 40% of the total well cost, necessitate cutting-edge solutions for enhanced safety, efficiency, and well integrity. This research focuses on the integration of fourth industrial revolution (4.IR) technologies, specifically addressing well integrity within well control domains. The strategic application of machine learning, the internet of things, robotics, automation, and big data analytics aims to optimize operations, mitigate risks, and safeguard well integrity. In the intricate landscape of drilling operations, the 4.IR technology becomes instrumental in ensuring well integrity. Rig sensors produce extensive, high-frequency data streams, and this research intricately examines how 4.IR technologies facilitate in-depth data analysis for safeguarding well integrity. The study delves into the technical advancements of 4.IR solutions, focusing on machine learning applications tailored for well integrity concerns, including early kick detection, pipe stuck prediction, wellbore stability, flux estimation, pore pressure prediction, and managed pressure drilling. Various machine learning techniques, data sources, features engineering, and target outputs achieved by developed models are explored.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Public acceptance is recognised as a key factor in the success of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. However, societal views vary significantly depending on the storage method. This study evaluates regional trends and public discourses surrounding two principal CCS approaches: dedicated geological storage and CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). By using surveys, focus groups, and case studies from North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, we identify common public concerns which include environmental risk, institutional trust, and questions of distributive fairness In addition, we see region-specific viewpoints shaped by economic reliance on fossil fuels and different climate policy frameworks. Dedicated geological CO2 storage tends to be associated more directly with climate mitigation but often faces public doubts due to perceived local risks and limited economic benefits. On the other hand, CO2-EOR is seen as more economically beneficial and is familiar in oil-producing areas, although it raises doubts about its validity as a climate solution. We investigate how these views affect permitting decisions, project timelines, and policy support. We argue that engaging with the public and incorporating their perspectives into project planning is crucial. By highlighting successful and unsuccessful cases, this study provides practical insights for developers and policymakers aiming to gain community support for CCS projects in various settings.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Capillary pressure is a fundamental petrophysical property that governs fluid distribution and movement within the porous media. It plays a critical role in processes such as fluid imbibition, drainage, and displacement efficiency, particularly in reservoir evaluation and development. Traditional methods for measuring capillary pressure are often destructive, time-consuming, or limited in resolution, especially for unconventional formations. This study presents a novel and non-destructive approach for estimating capillary pressure in unconventional formations using a multifrequency dielectric technique. In this study, various rock samples were used, including sandstone, carbonate, and shale, with different total organic carbon (TOC) and petrophysical properties were investigated. The samples exhibited porosities between 3% and 18%, permeabilities ranging from 350 nanoDarcy to 403 mD, and TOC values between 3.4 and 15.6 wt.%. A new experimental setup was developed to monitor the dielectric response as a function of capillary pressure. The permittivity and conductivity profiles were obtained across a frequency range of 4 to 3000 MHz in order to capture different polarization mechanisms. Cleaned and oven-dried samples were used to serve as baseline measurements for the dielectric profiles. Dielectric measurements were performed using an open-ended coaxial probe, while NMR T2 relaxation profiles were acquired using a GeoSpec spectrometer (Oxford Instruments) operating at…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Accurately predicting oil flow rate in the presence of near-wellbore damage remains a persistent challenge in well completion design, especially when multiple subsurface and fluid properties must be considered. This study introduces SkinFlow, an interactive Python-based application that helps evaluate flow efficiency in open-hole completions for both vertical and horizontal wells. Using established analytical models, the platform lets users adjust input parameters and instantly see the effect on skin factor and oil production rate. SkinFlow offers real-time sensitivity analysis, combined-parameter evaluation, and Monte Carlo simulation. Engineers can test the effect of individual variables or apply several changes together, mimicking treatments such as acidizing, damage removal, or wettability alteration. Probabilistic modeling allows uncertainty in key parameters to be represented through probability distributions, giving a realistic range of outcomes. To demonstrate its value, a case study compared two wells in the same reservoir. Well №2026 produced 500.1 STB/D with a skin of 7.19, while Well №2025, affected by severe damage, produced only 268.3 STB/D with a skin of 20.72. Deterministic stimulation modeling of Well №2025, with altered-zone permeability raised from 10 to 200 mD, increased production to 1207 STB/D and reduced the skin by 43.5 percent. Monte Carlo analysis confirmed clear gains, forecasting post-stimulation rates with a median of 981 STB/D. A second …&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Variation in rock type or any physical alterations in the rock has great impact on the Archie&apos;s parameter, unlike the brine conductivity which has no influence on these parameters. When the Ferric chloride (FeCl3) solution is injected into limestone formation, it reacts with the carbonates and alters the permeability. The current study aims to investigate the impact of low concentration FeCl3 on physical and electrical properties by intentionally altering the rock&apos;s characteristics which in turns changes the resistivity. The study uses Indiana limestone core samples having length of 2 inches and diameter of 1.5 inches. The centrifugation method was used to achieve uniform FeCl3 saturation levels inside the core samples while investigating the variation in their physical and electrical properties. The resistivity of core samples were determined at different FeCl3 saturations to examine its effect on the electrical properties. Medical CT was conducted on the core sample, both before and after treatment in order to understand the structure variation during the saturation and De-saturation. Furthermore, NMR analysis was performed for comprehensive insight into the pore system and fluid distribution inside the core sample. Additionally, geomechanical analysis showed a moderate decrease in Young&apos;s modulus and a slight increase in Poisson&apos;s ratio, consistent with mild matrix weakening. The initial porosity and permeability of samples were measured to be 17.7% and 16 mD resp…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: While the mortality rates for men are higher, the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic hit women differently. This qualitative study examines the experiences of eight Filipina frontliners who continued to work during the General Community Quarantine in Metro Manila. Respondents were selected through purposive sampling. The primary data collection method was in depth interview. Phenomenological study was utilized for data analysis. The research resulted in three major themes which emerged out of the experiences shared by the female frontliners (1) there exists a problem in safety and transportation among female frontliners; (2) stress develops from a high-risk work task; (3) coping strategies are utilized to manage daily stressors. Paying attention to concerns of female frontliners can potentially improve preventive practices and positive behaviors in combating the pandemic. There should be a gender lens on the response to COVID-19 to ensure that the unique needs women are addressed not just in the Philippines but in the whole world. Frontline female responders must be guaranteed protection safe working conditions support and fair compensation that answers their needs. Also, there is a necessity for sex and age disaggregated data to further understand how this crisis is impacting women and men differently and to support the data collected from the respondents in implementing gender sensitive an effective response to pandemics.&#10;Venue: Social Sciences Development Review&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Oil and gas exploration requires precise evaluation of various parameters, among which porosity and saturation are the most crucial and fundamental properties. Conventional logging methods like neutron, density, and sonic logs used for porosity measurements experience various challenges in heavy oil reservoirs. Thus, this study aims to reduce these challenges and uncertainty in estimating porosity and saturations in heavy oil reservoirs by utilizing specialized techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and multifrequency dielectric dispersion approaches. The study uses carbonate and sandstone rocks having an average permeability of 200 mD and porosity of 15% and 18.5%, respectively. The samples were then saturated with 3wt.% KCl brine followed by NMR, gravimetric, and dielectric measurements for porosity determination. Next, the samples were saturated with heavy oil that has a viscosity of more than 4500 cP using high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) flooding experiments. The NMR and dielectric measurements were again taken at different oil saturations, followed by CT scan analysis to visualize the oil and brine distribution inside the samples. Finally, the porosity and hydrocarbon saturations were compared with all the determination techniques. The result shows a significant impact of heavy oil on rock porosity estimation and dielectric measurements. The NMR porosities at fully brine-saturated samples were 16% and 19.3% for carbonate and sandstone, r…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>
