      <description>Abstract: ABSTRACT The Mid‐Cenomanian event has been recognised in a sedimentary outcrop exposed in north Jordan. A section belonging to the Cenomanian was logged in the Ajloun area to investigate calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy, microfacies, the carbon and oxygen isotope composition and elemental compositions. The Ajloun section is assigned to the UC‐2 biozone (early Cenomanian) based on the occurrence of the calcareous nannofossil marker species Gartnerago segmentatum and Cylindralithus sculptus . The first occurrence of Lithraphidites acutus in Sample 18 marks the base of the UC‐3 biozone (middle Cenomanian). The Ajloun bituminous limestone comprises four microfacies, namely wackestone, packstone, pack‐wackestone and mudstone. The X‐ray fluorescence (XRF) results indicate that the pre‐existing sediments underwent episodic erosion and weathering processes during the early‐middle Cenomanian. Moreover, TiO 2 exhibited the same trend as P 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 . The organic carbon isotope (δ 13 C) signatures reveal a trend towards the negative excursion that marked the onset of the anoxic event during the middle Cenomanian, indicating an increased abundance of light carbon within the Cenomanian seas. The following rapid positive shift of δ 13 C values in the middle part suggests that marine organic carbon accumulation rates were high as a result of the increasing ocean organic productivity. The relatively high TiO 2 , P 2 O 5 , SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 contents confirm this observ…&#10;Topics: Geology, Biozone, Total organic carbon, Anoxic waters, Isotopes of carbon&#10;Venue: Geological Journal&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Choosing a representative element volume (REV) from finite cylindrical $μ$CT scans becomes ambiguous when a key field variable exhibits a slow axial trend, because estimated statistics can change systematically with subvolume size and position rather than converging under simple averaging. A practical workflow is presented to size an REV under such nonstationary conditions by first suppressing axial drift/trend to obtain a residual field suitable for second-order analysis, and then selecting the smallest analysis diameter for which low-wavenumber content stabilizes within a prescribed tolerance. The approach is demonstrated on \textit{Thalassinoides}-bearing rocks, whose branching, connected burrow networks impose heterogeneity on length scales comparable to typical laboratory core diameters, making imaging-based microstructural statistics and downstream digital-rock proxies highly sensitive to the chosen subvolume. From segmented data, a scalar ``burrowsity&apos;&apos; field--capturing burrow-related pore spaces and infills--is defined, and axial detrending (with optional normalization) is applied to mitigate acquisition drift and nonstationary trends. Representativeness is then posed as a diameter-convergence problem on nested inscribed cylinders: the two-point covariance and its isotropic spectral counterpart $\widehat{C}$ are estimated, and the smallest diameter at which the low-wavenumber plateau becomes stable is selected.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study explores the use of machine learning to predict mechanical properties of subsurface rocks, such as indentation-based Elastic modulus, using input features from X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and gamma ray measurements. Traditional mechanical testing is costly, time-intensive, and often unfeasible for large datasets. Our goal is to develop a predictive tool that leverages accessible field and laboratory data to estimate geomechanical behavior, enabling real-time formation evaluation during drilling. By integrating in-situ measurements such as gamma ray logs while drilling and surface XRD/XRF analysis from cuttings, this approach supports live monitoring of the drilling process and improves on-site decision making without the need for routine lab-based mechanical testing. The dataset for this study was developed from direct experimental measurements on rock samples obtained during coring operations. All measurements were carried out in the laboratory: gamma ray signals were acquired through core scanning, mineralogical composition was determined using XRD, and elemental content was measured with XRF. Mechanical properties were then quantified through depth-resolved micro-indentation testing, ensuring that both geophysical and geochemical data were consistently tied to the same set of core samples. To evaluate predictive performance, we trained and validated multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boost…&#10;Topics: Coring, Support vector machine, Drilling, Geology, Data set&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive techno-economic assessment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) tailored to Saudi Arabia’s unique energy and industrial landscape. By constructing a detailed Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) that integrates capture, transportation, and storage costs, the analysis offers a perspective on the Kingdom’s potential to decarbonize its economy under the Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) framework. Leveraging spatial evaluations of the stationary emission sources and geological sinks, this study develops an optimized source-sink matching workflow specific to Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure and geology. Findings reveal that the current CCS costs (2024 USD) average approximately $81.4 per metric ton CO2 (tCO2), with capture costs dominating ($69/tCO2), while transportation and storage costs remain relatively low ($6.7/tCO2 and $5.7/tCO2, respectively). These results reflect the advantages of short distances between emitters and storage sites and the country’s extensive saline aquifer storage capacity. The study further shows that achieving the 2035 target of 44 MTPA of captured CO2 is feasible at a volume-weighted average cost of $52/tCO2 by prioritizing low-cost, high-concentration emission projects. The analysis also underscores the critical need for technological advancements in CO2 capture and targeted investments in CCS hubs and clusters to unlock the potential for large-scale decarbonization. This assessment provides actionable insights for policy…&#10;Topics: Carbon capture and storage (timeline), Environmental economics, Workflow, Environmental science, Carbon tax&#10;Venue: Energy Conversion and Management X&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Illite plays a critical role in diagenetic processes of sedimentary rocks, influencing geochemical evolution, reservoir quality, and fluid flow pathways. This study experimentally investigated the hydrothermal transformation of kaolinite to illite using sandstones from the Upper Ordovician Quwarah Member of Qasim Formation, northwest Saudi Arabia. Experiments were performed to simulate burial diagenesis involving illitization using three fluid systems: a synthetic solution (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2), natural Red Sea water, and modified Red Sea water (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2 + Red Sea water) at different temperatures (80 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C). Analysis included thin-section petrography, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, whereas the elemental compositions of the experimental solutions were analyzed using ICP-MS and Ion Chromatography. At 80 °C and 150 °C, kaolinite underwent dissolution without significant mineralogical changes. At 200 °C, continued kaolinite disaggregation and dissolution produced smectite and mixed smectite–chlorite/illite layers, indicating early transformation pathways. At 250 °C, fluid chemistry exerted strong control on clay minerals. The synthetic solution formed smectite with minor chlorite and illite; Red Sea water favored well developed smectite; the modified Red Sea water promoted well-developed illite due to increased potassium availability. The experiments show illitization is strongly temperature dependent and primarily…&#10;Venue: Minerals&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Organic-rich shale facies of the Lower Jurassic Datta Formation in the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan was studied using geological and geochemical investigation for assessment the unconventional oil shale reservoir potential. The Datta shale facies is a promising oil-prone stratum, consisting of total organic carbon (TOC) exceeding 2 wt.%, and primarily comprising Type II and II/III kerogens, with a hydrogen index (HI) exceeding 250 mg HC/g TOC. The Datta shale facies is also characterized by higher free hydrocarbon (S 1 ) than TOC, resulting in a high oil saturation index (OSI) between 30.81 mg HC/g TOC and 298.7 mg HC/g TOC, wherein the high OSI of more than 100 mg HC/g TOC indicates a strong potential for oil production. This finding consistent with the current thermally mature of oil window, ranging between early-mature and peak-mature, as supported by vitrinite reflectance (%VRo) values of up to 0.82. This main oil generation window leads to convert extensive of the hydrogen-rich kerogen for commercial oil generation, with a transformation ratio (TR) of up to 65%, as demonstrated in the 1-D basin modeling. The maximum oil generation, with TR values exceeding 50%, leads to high pressure and results in micro-fracture pores in the Datta shale facies. The presence of the non-fabric fracture pores is confirmed by the high-resolution petrographic scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Consequently, these findings highlight that the Datta shale facies is considered for use as an unco…&#10;Venue: Petroleum Geoscience&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

Multi-temporal PS-InSAR analysis from 2010 to 2023 revealed cumulative surface deformation and tilt anomalies. Micro-seismic and fault proximity data assessed subsurface stress, while a flood risk map-based surface deformation-adjusted elevation captured hydrological susceptibility. All datasets were standardized into five risk zones (ranging from very low to very high) and combined through a weighted overlay analysis, with an emphasis on surface deformation and micro seismic factors. The resulting risk map highlights a central corridor of high vulnerability where subsidence, seismic activity, and drainage pathways converge, overlapping critical infrastructure. The results demonstrate that integrating geomechanical and hydrological factors yields a more accurate assessment of infrastructure risk than single-hazard approaches. This framework is adaptable to other petroleum fields, enhancing infrastructure protection (e.g., pipelines, flowlines, wells, and other oil and gas facilities), and supporting sustainable field management.&#10;Venue: Earth&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Constraining past topography and the shape of Earth’s surface is the next frontier in palaeogeography and full-plate tectonic modelling. Mountains are highly dynamic on geological time scales, growing in response to tectonic processes such as subduction and continent collision, and eroding as they are exposed to precipitation and time. Mountain ranges regulate atmospheric circulation and enforce a first order control on dissolved river loads and the transport of sediments to sedimentary basins. Because of this, mountains and the changing elevation of Earth’s surface are essential to understanding how the wider Earth system has evolved through time. Here we present a computational full-Earth, forward model of palaeotopography and palaeobathymetry from 1 Ga to present-day. We use an existing full- plate tectonic model, which traces the evolution of tectonic plate boundaries, to automatically isolate specific tectonic environments that are associated with mountain building, such as continental arcs, continental collisions, rifts and large igneous provinces. Our model separates Earth’s continental surface into a set of equally spaced nodes, so that each node can record its own unique topographic evolution, independent of the nodes around it. Once these regions have been identified, we simulate their growth, and decay, over the last 1 Ga, using parameters and limits derived from the present-day expression of topography on Earth. Our model produces a set of maps at 1° resolution an…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for the automated classification of 12 foraminifera species using 2D micro-CT slices derived from 3D scans. We curated a scientifically rigorous dataset comprising 97 micro-CT scanned specimens across 27 species, selecting 12 species with sufficient representation for robust machine learning. To ensure methodological integrity and prevent data leakage, we employed specimen-level data splitting, resulting in 109,617 high-quality 2D slices (44,103 for training, 14,046 for validation, and 51,468 for testing). We evaluated seven state-of-the-art 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning. Our final ensemble model, combining ConvNeXt-Large and EfficientNetV2-Small, achieved a test accuracy of 95.64%, with a top-3 accuracy of 99.6% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.998 across all species. To facilitate practical deployment, we developed an interactive advanced dashboard that supports real-time slice classification and 3D slice matching using advanced similarity metrics, including SSIM, NCC, and the Dice coefficient. This work establishes new benchmarks for AI-assisted micropaleontological identification and provides a fully reproducible framework for foraminifera classification research, bridging the gap between deep learning and applied geosciences.&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Late Cretaceous Pukeiwitahi Formation is a good petroleum source rock in Canterbury basin of New Zealand. The Pukeiwitahi coals and carbonaceous shales in the offshore Canterbury Basin were geochemically analysed, including total sulfur and organic carbon (TOC) contents with finding from stable carbon isotope and biomarker measurements. These geochemical results were used to provide information about inputs of organic matter and dispositional setting and their effect on the occurrences of organic matter. The Pukeiwitahi coal and shale samples are characterzied by TOC from 7.44 to 73.74%, with sulfur content between 1.07 and 3.13%, resulting in very low sulfur-to-carbon ratios of less than 0.1 and indicating well-oxygenated environmental conditions. The Pukeiwitahi coal and carbonaceous shale sequence also shows high pristane/phytane ratios and low C31R/C30 hopane and DPT/P ratios, suggesting high oxygenated fluvial to fluvio-deltaic environments. These coal and carbonaceous shale sediments are also characterzied by high values of Tm/Ts and C24Te/C26Ti ratios, along with high abundance of C29 regular sterane, indicating high accumulation of terrigenous organic matter. This finding is further corroborated by the outcome of bulk carbon isotopes of hydrocarbon fractions. Maturity biomarker-related parameters and ratios show that the Pukeiwitahi sediments reached diffrent thermal maturity levels, ranging from very early-mature and moderate mature of oil window.

      <description>Abstract: ABSTRACT Organic‐rich shale facies of the Lower Cretaceous Sembar Formation in the Lower Indus Basin, southern Pakistan, was studied to assess the original organic matter (OM) input and depositional environment, and to anticipate the impact of thermal maturity levels on the thermogenic gas formation from oil‐to‐gas conversion. The Sembar shales exhibit high total organic carbon (TOC) and sulphur concentrations, with TOC/S ratios exceeding 1 in dominant samples, suggesting deposition under low‐oxygenated marine environmental conditions. The organic carbon enrichment in Sembar shale facies is attributed to low‐oxygen depositional settings combined with extended intervals of warm‐water conditions. Molecular biomarker evidence such as abundant tricyclic terpanes, and a higher proportion of C 27 regular steranes relative to their C 28 and C 29 homologues indicates that the OM within the Sembar shale facies is predominantly sourced from marine algae and bacteria, with minor terrigenous land plant input. This high abundance of aquatic organisms in Sembar shale facies indicates that hydrogen‐rich Types II and II/III kerogen were the original OM input during deposition. This finding contradicts the current measured low hydrogen index (HI) values, between 2 mg HC/g TOC and 138 mg HC/g TOC, indicative of predominantly Types III and IV kerogen in the studied exploration wells. This drastic alteration of the original hydrogen‐rich OM is interpreted as thermal overprinting, wherein the hyd…&#10;Venue: Geological Journal&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study investigates the efficiency of a water-soluble nickel-based catalyst precursor in enhancing oil recovery through steam injection processes. Four filtration experiments were performed using a bulk formation model with initial oil saturation to simulate steam injection in a carbonate reservoir. The experiments focused on the effects of catalyst concentration, soaking time, and temperature on oil displacement efficiency. Results revealed that the highest oil recovery factor (displacement coefficient) of 36.3% was achieved with the injection of a commercial nickel sulfate-based catalyst, accompanied by an extended soaking time of 24 h. The displaced oil exhibited significantly reduced viscosity and a decreased content of heavy fractions, including resins and asphaltenes, indicating improved oil quality. Furthermore, the study underscored the critical influence of temperature on catalyst adsorption dynamics. Notably, adsorption increased with rising temperatures, with over 99% of the catalyst being adsorbed on the rock at temperatures exceeding 160 °C. Interestingly, at lower temperatures, adsorption was more pronounced on rock with residual oil saturation compared to that with extracted oil, suggesting that residual oil may facilitate better catalyst retention. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between steam injection parameters and catalytic efficiency in heavy oil recovery, offering insights that could enhance the design and optimiz…&#10;Venue: Scientific Reports&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Urbanization and climate change are intensifying the co-occurrence of drought and surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects, yet their combined dynamics remain poorly understood at high spatial resolution. This study evaluates the compound risk of drought and UHI in South Korea&apos;s Saemangeum region using a hybrid KNN–LSTM model, alongside three comparative approaches (KNN, CNN, CNN–LSTM), incorporating CMIP6 climate projections and satellite-derived land metrics. The KNN–LSTM model demonstrated superior performance (R² = 0.94; MSE = 0.0053), accurately capturing an increasing drought–SUHI association, which rose from 0.84 (1991–2020) to 1.00 by 2100 under the SSP585 scenario. High-risk zones predominantly overlap with built-up and cropland areas, where UHI indices exceed 4.0 and drought probabilities surpass 0.9. Although land use explains over 80% of drought variability under baseline conditions, its predictive power diminishes under future warming, highlighting the growing role of climate feedbacks. These findings emphasize the emergence of synchronized thermal and hydrological stressors in urbanizing coastal regions and underscore the need for integrated land-climate adaptation strategies supported by machine learning-based early warning systems.&#10;Venue: Geocarto International&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: Knowledge about environmental change and the evolutionary history of hominins in Arabia has been rapidly developing over the last two decades. Interdisciplinary research on humans and environments across the vast and heterogenous landmass of the Arabian Peninsula remains, however, highly spatially uneven. Here we present the results of archaeological, hydro-geological, and palaeontological research in inland northeastern Arabia, a poorly studied area with diverse landscape features including caves, palaeorivers, and chert outcrops. Hominin use of the landscape appears to be sparse in comparison to other regions of Arabia, though archaeological evidence spanning from the Lower Palaeolithic to the historic era was identified, including finds from the Middle Palaeolithic, which is the most well represented period. The caves of inland northeast Arabia contain a rich record of past climate change in the form of speleothems, as well as abundant faunal assemblages. Our survey results highlight the significant potential of these records to cast light on environmental, faunal, and cultural changes over time while demonstrating regional variation across Arabia.&#10;Venue: PLoS ONE&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Luminescence dating of interdune sabkha sediments and cross strata deposited on the lee face of a 160-m-high mega-crescentic dune in the eastern Rub’ al-Khali sand sea provides information on dune dynamics and preservation potential. Optically stimulated luminescence ages show that the rates of dune accumulation varied during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene. Sedimentary structures indicate that megadune migration was the result of strong northwesterly “Shamal” winds. During the same interval of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, linear dunes in the northeastern United Arab Emirates were also accumulating rapidly, indicating that the period 16−9 ka was characterized by regionally widespread dune formation and/or reworking. The dune has subsequently migrated to the SSE almost 900 m since the early Holocene, at an average rate of 77 m/k.y., indicating persistence of the Shamal wind system for at least 20 k.y. Rates of megadune migration and wet sabkha accumulation reveal that, despite their very large size, less than 1% of the megadune would be preserved in a sedimentary record.&#10;Venue: Geology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: ABSTRACT The Lower Cretaceous Yamama Formation of southern Iraq represents a key carbonate reservoir within Iraq and the Middle East, yet its complex depositional facies architecture and diagenetic alterations present challenges for predicting reservoir quality. This study integrates well‐log interpretation, detailed description of about 400 m of core intervals, petrographic analysis, fluid‐inclusion microthermometry, and stable‐isotope (δ 13 C, δ 18 O) geochemistry from several oilfields to determine the controls on reservoir heterogeneity. Fourteen depositional facies are recognized across a W–E‐trending, slightly steepening homoclinal ramp. These vary into four reservoir (YRA–YRD) and four nonreservoir (B0–B3) units. Reservoir intervals consist mainly of shoal grain‐supported peloids and ooids and Lithocodium–Bacinella reefal facies, whereas mud‐supported lagoonal and middle‐ramp facies form permeability barriers. Diagenetic processes exerted strong control on reservoir quality evolution. Early marine rim and scattered calcite cements preserved interparticle pores in the grain‐supported limestone facies, whereas burial equant calcite sourced by stylolitization of the host limestones reduced porosity. The precipitation of pore‐filling kaolin and saponite in the mud‐supported limestone facies limited porosity.

      <description>Abstract: &lt;title&gt;Abstract&lt;/title&gt; To maximize the utilization of Mg-rich natural resources for CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal (CDR), an integrated strategy has been proposed that focuses on synthesizing reactive CDR materials aimed at both climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability. This study demonstrates the use of lizardite-rich natural feedstock, an abundant and accessible resource, combined with industrial marble waste. Through thermal treatment at elevated temperatures, this mixture yields a reactive CDR material primarily composed of forsterite and lime. Carbonation experiments of the synthesized material show complete transformation of lime into calcite and substantial weathering of forsterite into hydrated and carbonated secondary minerals. Compared to the Ca₂SiO₄ + MgO system, the synthesized material exhibits higher eco-efficiency with comparable CO₂ sequestration, storing ~ 21% as CaCO₃ and ~ 6% as MgCO₃ in 30 days versus ~ 25% and ~ 5% over 7 weeks (Chen and Kanan 2025), while promoting sustainable industrial waste valorization. Additionally, forsterite is more suitable for ocean alkalinity enhancement applications, whereas Ca₂SiO₄ is better aligned with use in the cement industry. Taken together, we propose that our material has strong potential for large-scale deployment in ex-situ carbon mineralization, ocean alkalinity enhancement, soil amendment, industrial point-source capture, and in-situ geological carbonation. This potential depends on developing sustaina…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The tectonic terranes in the Proterozoic outcrops in Saudi Arabia are separated from those in Yemen by extensive regions that are covered by Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks and Tertiary volcanics. As a result, correlations of specific terranes between the two Proterozoic outcrop regions are inconclusive, and our understanding of how the terranes were assembled during the Proterozoic remains uncertain. In this study, we used aeromagnetic images to join the Halaban suture in Saudi Arabia’s Proterozoic outcrops with the Bayhan suture in Yemen’s Proterozoic outcrops beneath ca. 700 km of cover rocks. The Halaban suture is NS-oriented and extends from 29o00’N to 22o10’N between 44o00’E and 44o30’E and passes into the Halaban ophiolite belt in Saudi Arabia’s Proterozoic outcrops. At 22o10’N, it is displaced left-laterally by ca. 60 km along the NW-trending Ar Rika fault zone, and farther southeast its trace is interpreted between 21o30’N and 17o00’N beneath the cover rocks. In southern Yemen, it continues into the SW-trending ophiolite-bearing Bayhan suture between 17o00’N and 13o00’N across three Proterozoic outcrops to near the Red Sea coast. The Halaban and Bayhan zones are interpreted as the collisional suture of the Amar orogeny that peaked at ca. 620-615 Ma. The mapped extent of the Halaban-Bayhan suture in this study is 1600 km long and divides Arabia into western and eastern sets of terranes. It provides a spatio-temporal constraint at ca. 620 Ma for plate-tectonic r…&#10;Venue: Lithosphere&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: Flood hazards in arid oil-producing regions are significantly influenced by both natural hydrological processes and terrain changes resulting from subsidence. This study develops a deformation-adjusted approach to flood risk assessment for the Yibal field in the northern part of the Sultanate of Oman, where long-term hydrocarbon production has led to measurable ground deformation. A high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from an aerial survey in 2013 was adjusted using cumulative surface deformation data (2013–2023) derived from PS-InSAR measurements. By subtracting the surface deformation from the baseline DEM, an updated DEM for 2023 was produced that explicitly incorporates subsidence into hydrological modeling. Weighted flood risk mapping was then performed using slope, precipitation, land use/land cover, and drainage parameters. Results show a marked increase of flood vulnerability, with high- to very high-risk zones (8.0-8.6, 8.7-9.6) expanding in areas affected by surface deformation. These findings demonstrate that conventional flood risk mapping, which neglects subsidence, can underestimate hazard levels in petroleum fields where ground deformation alters drainage pathways. Incorporating subsidence-adjusted terrain data into hydrological risk assessment provides more realistic flood susceptibility maps, improving early warning, infrastructure protection, and sustainable petroleum field management. Beyond the Yibal field, the method is transferable to other pet…&#10;Venue: Preprints.org&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The uppermost 2 meters of the Maastrichtian Scaglia Rossa Fm. (Gubbio, Italy) record a notable change in the proportions of morphogroups of deep-water agglutinated foraminifera beginning about 1.4 m below the boundary, where we observe a gradual decrease in the abundance of the morphotype M4 (infauna) and a concurrent increase in the morphotype M1 (suspension feeders). This trend suggests a reduction in the flux of organic matter to the sea floor began approximately 114 k.y. before the boundary event. The abundance of M4 shows an abrupt decline from around 13% below the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, to a minimum of 7% in the beds directly above the boundary. This trend suggests a modest, but temporary reduction in organic matter flux to the sea floor following the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary event, though not in the category of a “Strangelove Ocean”. Morphotype M1 shows a marked decrease across the boundary, with values decreasing from &amp;gt;70% to around 11%. The lower Paleocene displays strong fluctuations in the M4 morphogroup. In the same interval we observe a rise in Morphotype M2 (epifaunal detritivores) from values below 10% in the Maastrichtian to over 50% in the basal Paleocene, and a short-lived maximum in Morphotype M3, indicating a decline in particulate organic matter input from suspension and a concurrent increase in bacterial-derived organic matter in the early recovery phase of the Paleocene.

      <description>Abstract: Groundwater level predictive monitoring is necessary to address accelerated aquifer depletion and ensure sustainable management under increasing climatic and anthropogenic pressures. This study uses machine learning approaches to model groundwater level (GWL) dynamics in six observation wells in the Ruataniwha Basin, New Zealand. These models are enhanced with seasonal decomposition techniques. This study uses both static properties and dynamic variables to capture hydrogeological heterogeneity. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), with seasonal decomposition preprocessing, were developed for GWL modelling. The models were trained on 80% of the dataset and tested using the remaining 20% of the data. Model accuracy was assessed using five statistical metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and percent bias (PBIAS). Model uncertainty was analyzed using Bayesian Model Averaging combined with the p-factor and d-factor at the 95% confidence level. The results demonstrate that both models delivered strong predictive performance across training, testing, and full period evaluations. However, the RF model demonstrated a marginally superior predictive accuracy by achieving lower errors (MAE: 0.013–0.174; RMSE: 0.04–0.283), better bias control (PBIAS ≈ 0%), and slightly tighter error bounds in most wells. Uncertainty quantification revealed that models provided a minimu…&#10;Venue: Hydrology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study reports a well-developed columnar joint set in organic-rich carbonate source rocks, exhibiting distinct vertical prismatic columns with hexagonal to polygonal cross sections. These columnar joints are found within the Upper Cretaceous Muwaqqar Chalk Marl (MCM) Formation, in central Jordan. While columnar joints are commonly observed in igneous rocks, their occurrence in carbonate mudrocks is unique and has rarely been documented in stratigraphic records. This study aims to characterize the geometry and petrographic features of columnar joints observed in organic-rich carbonate source rocks and investigate the mineralogical and geochemical alterations associated with their development. Thorough petrographic and geochemical investigations were carried out to better understand the characteristics, paleoenvironmental context, and associated processes that controlled the formation of these honeycomb-shaped mudrocks. Our findings suggest that the observed columnar joints resulted from subsurface thermal alteration due to the endogenous combustion of the organic-rich carbonate source rocks. This combustion process has led to the development of joints oriented perpendicular to the bedding planes, extending throughout a 2-m-thick interval. These joints slightly taper downward while preserving their polygonal pattern, with column diameter decreasing from 3 to 1 cm. The development of columnar joints within the study interval is primarily attributed to volume contraction resu…&#10;Venue: ACS Omega&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) data are prone to missingness and errors. Previously, we devised an &quot;enriched&quot; chart review protocol where a &quot;roadmap&quot; of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values in EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a missing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart reviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients whose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of a roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing values. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians&apos; original roadmap from our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined using large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to expand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm performance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients, we applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved additions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more, missing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap. Discussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing EHR data with similar accuracy…&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The Eocene epoch is known for its fluctuations in climate patterns and the dominance of global greenhouse climate. The Rashrashiyah Formation represents the middle to upper Eocene (biozones E13–E14) marine deposits of claystone to limestone in Saudi Arabia and contains well- to poorly-preserved planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Four different genera were selected for isotopic analysis (Acarinina spp., Subbotina spp., Cibicidoides spp., and Uvigerina spp.). Foraminiferal calcite was used to define the depth of habitat for each genus and mode of life. Four equations were used to infer palaeotemperatures from foraminiferal calcite; three equations are applicable for estimation of sea-surface temperatures (SST) from planktonic foraminifera data, while the fourth equation is applicable estimation of bottom-water temperatures using benthic foraminifera data. The mean SST derived from Acarinina spp. is ~38°C, while the mean bottom water temperature based on Uvigerina spp. is 26°C. Palaeotemperatures derived from this study are notably higher than those reported from this area in the existing literature. This discrepancy may be due to the unique palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic conditions prevalent in the study area. The stable isotope curve is used to infer the transition between the Bartonian and Priabonian and the general cooling trend during this period.&#10;Venue: Geological Quarterly&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

This study evaluated the combination of Cal and paclitaxel (PTX) in a polymeric micelle formulation (M-Cal/PTX) to improve drug distribution and efficacy in a PDAC mouse model. Methods: Cal and PTX were encapsulated in a 1:3 ratio in a polymeric micelle (Size: 40-50 nm, Polydispersity index:⁓0.2). In vitro: Nile Red incorporated into the polymeric micelle was used to image the cellular uptake in Kras* Cells on confocal microscopy. In vivo: Using an orthotopic Kras* PDAC mouse model, we assessed the antitumor effect of M-Cal/PTX. Mice were divided and randomized into three groups: M-Cal/PTX (1.8 mg/kg-5.5 mg/kg) (n=7), Abraxane (8 mg/kg) (n=6), and vehicle (sham polymeric micelle) (n=6). Doses were administered intravenously (11 doses)/intraperitoneally (4 doses), five days per week for three weeks, and all surviving animals were sacrificed after the fourth week. Tumors were harvested at the end of the study, weighed, and compared. Results: Sectional imaging from confocal microscopy showed a cytoplasmic uptake of the micelles in Kras* cells within 5 minutes of incubation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed median survival times of ∼14–15 days for vehicle, ∼21.5 days for Abraxane…&#10;Venue: Cancer Research&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Dolomite formation remains a debated topic in sedimentary geology, particularly concerning the mechanisms driving its precipitation under natural conditions. While microbial processes have been well studied, the influence of abiotic factors, such as clay minerals, is less understood. This study uses hydrothermal reactor experiments at 80–250 °C to examine the role of clay minerals in post-compactional dolomitization. Results show that smectite and illite effectively promote dolomitization by providing nucleation sites and aiding Mg2+ dehydration through their highly negative surface charges. In contrast, kaolinite and dickite were less effective due to their charge neutrality. In calcite-kaolinite mixtures, dolomite formed at 200 °C when kaolinite partially converted to smectite but was inhibited at 250 °C due to dickite formation. Samples containing only calcite showed little to no dolomite formation, highlighting the role of reactive clays. Dolomitization occurred through two mechanisms: (1) complete calcite dissolution followed by dolomite nucleation, and (2) recrystallization with progressive Mg incorporation. These findings support clay-catalyzed dolomitization as a significant abiotic pathway in ancient muddy carbonates and mixed clastic-carbonate systems.&#10;Venue: Geology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: A bstract The Eocene Epoch is characterised by multiple hyperthermals, which promoted extensive carbonate sediment deposition and dolomitisation, particularly across the Arabian Plate. The Dammam Formation, a key Eocene aquifer and hydrocarbon‐bearing unit in the Arabian platform, is extensively dolomitised. Several models have been proposed to explain its dolomitisation, many of which invoke sea water or its derivatives as the dolomitising fluid. However, the specific sea water‐driven mechanisms remain poorly understood. More broadly, the effectiveness of commonly used diagenetic proxies (e.g. stable isotopes, stoichiometry and trace elements) in distinguishing between closely related sea water‐driven dolomitisation processes has not been systematically assessed. This study addresses these issues by integrating petrographic, mineralogical, chemical and stable isotopic (δ 13 C and δ 18 O) analyses of a shallow subsurface core from the Dammam Formation. Two distinct dolomite types were identified: Type I (TI), predominantly subhedral and Type II (TII), exhibiting euhedral and subhedral textures. Both types are pervasive, fabric non‐selective and non‐mimetic. The dolomite pre‐dates all other diagenetic processes, such as the formation of palygorskite, calcite, pyrite and stylolite, indicating early, shallow emplacement. Mineralogical data reveal that TI dolomite is near‐stoichiometric (51.4 mol%CaCO 3 ), and well‐ordered, while TII is non‐stoichiometric (56.3 mol%CaCO 3 ) and p…&#10;Venue: The Depositional Record&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Carbonate diagenesis is one of the key processes that ultimately controls reservoir quality and storage capacity of carbonate reservoirs. The rates of early marine diagenetic reactions in the geological past are little constrained. Fundamental physical experiments allow the calibration of early carbonate diagenesis for a variety of further applications, e.g., process-based modeling, fluid-flow and ultimately, reservoir and storage simulation. We conducted a year-long flume tank experiment to study cementation along a supratidal to subtidal depositional profile, with the aim of improving our understanding of early marine cementation. The experiment used artificial sea water with periodic oscillation in water level to create supratidal, intertidal and subtidal diagenetic environments. To simulate an active deposition zone in the subtidal environment, we established a &quot;subtidal zone with deposition&quot; by periodically adding thin layers of carbonate sediment on a monthly basis. Monthly sampling was conducted, with four samples collected to characterize the distinct depositional environments. Furthermore, a quantitative diagenetic model was developed to predict the cementation process within the tank, which was calibrated using experimental water chemistry data. This integrated approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the depositional and diagenetic processes occurring in the simulated subtidal environment.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The global transition to a low-carbon energy future has ignited interest in hydrogen as a clean and versatile energy carrier. NW Saudi Arabia contains vast tracts of mantle-dominated Neoproterozoic ophiolites overlain by a sedimentary cover in the north, NE and east. Our research explores the untapped potential of Saudi Arabia’s ophiolite serpentinites as a possible source of hydrogen generation through serpentinization and related processes. H2 is commonly derived from serpentinization, which primarily involves the hydration of minerals rich in iron and magnesium (e.g., olivine), resulting in the formation of serpentine and H2. Serpentinites are formed by reaction between hydrothermal fluids and mantle rocks, and hydrogen and methane are released in extreme reducing conditions. Under strongly reducing conditions, the formation of magnetite generates hydrogen during serpentinization, following reactions such as: 3Fe2SiO4 + 2H2O = 2Fe3O4 +3SiO2 +2H2. We have conducted a comprehensive assessment of serpentinites in the Arabian Shield, employing the Geographic Information System (GIS) to locate Arabian ophiolites with the largest ultramafic segments. Ophiolites studied include Jabal Ess, Jabal Wask, Bi’r Tululah, and Jabal Tharwah. After ophiolite identification, we delineated fractures and measured fracture density to provide insight into the potential of serpentinite fractures on the amount of possible hydrogen seepage, or natural accumulation in case of an overlying …&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Saudi Arabia, located on the Arabian tectonic plate, is a promising area for exploring sites for natural hydrogen production and accumulation due to the broad existence of ophiolitic ultramafic rocks, especially serpentinites. These rocks, recognized as accreted forearc fragments, are exposed in the western and northwestern segments of the Precambrian Arabian Shield. The present study aims to model the geometry and depth of two ophiolitic suites in NW Saudi Arabia by analyzing airborne magnetic data. The airborne magnetic data were analyzed using edge-detection algorithms (magnetic field derivatives) to study the distribution of lineaments corresponding to rock contacts and tectonic structures, and a lineament density map was produced. The magnetic susceptibility of rock samples collected during field surveys in the broader study area was measured in the lab. The measured values were used as constraints for the 3D inversion of the magnetic data. A 3D geophysical model was constructed and used to determine the tectonic regime of the subsurface in relation to the distribution of the ophiolitic bodies. The lineament map presented the distribution of the tectonic structures, while the lineament density map indicated highly fractured areas. These areas are suitable for the infiltration of rainwater, which creates aquifers into the ophiolitic bodies. These highly fractured areas could serve as water carriers for serpentinization processes at suitable temperatures and provi…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract While CO2 mineralization is a crucial area of research for climate change mitigation, the potential of Saudi Arabian scoriaceous basalts has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to assess these unique basalts as a potential CO2 sink by conducting a longer aging study and, paving the way for Saudi Arabia and regions with similar geological formations to actively contribute to carbon sequestration and emission reduction, supporting sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Climate Action. Scoriaceous basalts were sourced from the Harrat Uwayrid volcanic field in western Saudi Arabia. To simulate CO2 mineralization conditions, these samples were aged in a brine-CO2 environment at 50°C and 1450 psi over three months. Advanced imaging techniques, including micro-CT and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were employed to evaluate the mineralization potential and structural alterations within the basalt. Pre- and post-aging assessments provided detailed insights into the mineralization process occurring within the basalt groundmass, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the changes induced by CO2 exposure. The Micro-CT analysis showed a significant increase in porosity for the scoriaceous basalt sample after three months in a brine-CO2 environment, with porosity rising from an initial 5.72% to 14.89%. Furthermore, it showed that precipitation occurred along the sites of dissolution.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Our study demonstrates the application of seismic sequence stratigraphy interpretation in carbonate-anhydrite dominated interval from sabkha to inner ramp depositional setting. The primary objective is to reconstruct regional stratigraphic architecture including the lateral and vertical distribution of the Arab, Hith, and Asab Formation across the Abu Dhabi area. The regional seismic transects were utilized to perform chronostratigraphy correlation of several wells in the Arab and Hith Formation as well as the equivalent Asab Formation across UAE. Finally, integration with the wellbore data describes reservoir quality and hydrocarbon distribution that have potential for stratigraphic and/or diagenetic traps. A comprehensive and regional approach utilizing various subsurface data including 2D seismic reflection profiles, and wellbore data are presented. Integrated seismic facies analysis, seismic instantaneous attribute, and seismic density inversion, as well as sequence stratigraphy combined with detail petrographic analysis have been applied to reconstruct regional stratigraphic framework and reservoir characterization of the carbonate-evaporites system of the Arab Formation. Four second-order sequences from mud-dominated basinal limestones, grain-supported oolitic and skeletal shoals, and lagoonal to supratidal anhydrite-rich deposits were interpreted.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Quantifying and accurately measuring bulk permeability in bioturbated strata remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the difficulty of obtaining representative samples that adequately capture connected networks controlling fluid flow. These representative volumes often exceed the laboratory-scale testing. Previously, permeability assessments for such large samples have relied on numerical simulations, where direct permeability measurements for these large burrowed strata remain challenging. However, recent advancements in computed tomography (CT) imaging and 3D printing technologies have enabled high-resolution reconstruction of burrow networks, which can then be scaled down to laboratory-compatible sizes. Despite this progress, issues persist, particularly with 3D-printed replicas produced via fused deposition modeling (FDM). These models frequently fail under the confining pressures applied during permeability testing due to structural deficiencies and fluid leakage. After the failure of ten FDM-printed replicas, this study identifies critical parameters for achieving mechanically robust replicas. Specifically, Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) PETG (filament demonstrated markedly superior load-bearing capacity and pressure tolerance compared to Polylactic Acid PLA, significantly minimizing sample failure. Furthermore, the use of 100% matrix infill was found to be crucial for maintaining structural integrity, despite the longer print times required. Fina…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Smart Chemical Modifier (SeMAR) is a crucial enhanced oil recovery technique for petroleum production, particularly in the heterogeneous sandstone system. This study focuses on the application of SeMAR for enhancing oil recovery in the Hemiar oilfield, located in the Masila Basin of Eastern Yemen. In the Hemiar oilfield, the S2 sandstone reservoir presents complex mineralogy due the depositional and diagenetic processes, exhibiting low permeability system. The aim of the current study was to assess the influence of SeMAR on the behavior of the heavy oil collected from 19 core samples in diffrent burial depths in the Hemiar-21exploration well. In this case, different chemical formulations of the SeMAR were used to achieve a precise the efficiency of heavy oil displacement using different laboratory tests such as phase behavior, compatibility, spontaneous imbibition, emulsion viscosity measurement, and core rock stability. The highlighted results demonstrate that the SeMAR formulations improve the efficiency of heavy oil displacement from the heterogeneous sandstone reservoir system in the Hemiar Field, particularly 1% S16A formulation. The 1% S16A was the most effective surfactant, exhibiting the lowest viscosity (7.0 cp.) at a 50% oil concentration, which enhanced the oil mobility and recovery efficiency. The results of this study provide promising insights into the optimization of SeMAR formulations to maximize oil recovery in the Hemiar Field, with a relatively hig…&#10;Venue: Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The effectiveness of an iron nitrate catalyst (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) was experimentally investigates to improve the efficiency of steam injection for in-situ hydrothermal conversion of Domanik low-permeable shale rock, with the aim of improving both the quantity and quality of produced synthetic oil. The experiments were performed under hydrothermal condition at 300℃ and 350℃ for 24 hours and at 400℃ for 3 hours. The generated synthetic oils and produced gases was analyzed using GC, GC-MS chromatography, gas chromatography, elemental and SARA analysis. The obtained results revealed that the addition of iron nitrate led to a significant increase in synthetic oil yield by 2.56% at 300℃, 5.39% at 350℃ and 4.87% at 400℃, as opposed to non-catalytic conditions. The optimal condition was identified at 350℃, which yielded higher amounts of light n-alkanes (C9-C20) compared to heavy n-alkanes. The results of SARA analysis and GC-MS also showed high aliphatic hydrocarbons content within the generated synthetic oil. Furthermore, XRD analysis revealed that the presence of iron sulfides (FeS2) and iron oxides (Fe2O3) plays a significant role in facilitating the effective desulfurization of bitumen and kerogen. These findings highlight the catalytic potential of water-soluble iron nitrate in hydrothermal treatment, offering valuable insights for optimizing synthetic oil production from oil shale.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

The primary focus is on the geochemical processes occurring during seawater-groundwater mixing with emphasis on mineral dissolution/precipitation, cation exchange, adsorption, and trace element mobilization. 3D lab-scale physical experiments were carried out to simulate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers using local aquifer materials, groundwater, and seawater. The lab experiments were conducted under various hydrogeological conditions and variable control factors to simulate groundwater dynamics in sandy coastal aquifers impacted by seawater intrusion. Post-experiment advanced geochemical analysis was performed to describe the chemical change of groundwater characteristics during seawater intrusion. Inverse geochemical modeling was performed to identify the geochemical processes that controlled the water chemistry during the seawater intrusion experiment. The lab experiment data were used to validate geochemical models. The integrated lab-scale experiment and inverse geochemical modeling reveal that the seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers has significantly impacted the groundwater quality through increasing salinity and trace element mobilization. The study showed that significant changes in groundwater quality occurred during low pumping and no recharge scenarios …&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Palynomorph Darkness Index (PDI) is a fully quantitative optical method for assessing thermal maturity which has been established as a rapid and low-cost ‘add-on’ to palynostratigraphic investigations, especially in pre-Devonian sediments. Here, we applied the PDI method to Silurian strata in Saudi Arabia to enhance calibration of Acritarch PDI to vitrinite reflectance (VRo) via Vitrinite Reflectance Equivalents (VREs) such as pyrolysis-based Tmax determination, and graptolite and chitinozoan reflectance. Unoxidised palynological concentrates were obtained from core samples from various sections in Saudi Arabia from the early Silurian (Qalibah Formation) and a maturity range from immature through the oil, condensate and gas windows to the postmature stage. PDI measurements were taken on suitable acritarch taxa using a transmitted light optical microscope and a digital camera. The PDI values obtained were correlated with VREs derived from Tmax, graptolite reflectance and chitinozoan reflectance. Published PDI – VRo correlations established in Devonian-Carboniferous sections in the eastern USA were also considered. The present results confirm that acritarch PDI can be successfully applied for thermal maturity estimation, especially in pre-Devonian age, organic-rich sediments, where most of the available alternative methods show weak correlation toVRo. The most suitable acritarchs for PDI determination are the Veryhachium / Neoveryhachium Group. Preliminary results sugg…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Summary Simulating multi-phase flow at length scale larger than measured scale has been an active topic for decades. In this study, we address the numerical challenges associated with estimating effective relative permeability and capillary pressure (usually known as saturation functions) of dual porosity systems. Specifically, we introduce a modified version of periodic boundary conditions applied in steady-state upscaling workflow. Our modification is based on mirror-periodic boundary conditions as a reasonable choice overcoming short failings introduced through direct application of periodic boundary conditions. This modification can be seamlessly coupled with previous approaches handling force balance spectrum from capillary limit to viscous limit. In addition, the resultant relative permeability is a tensor allowing for modeling complex geometrical configurations. The approach is demonstrated through estimation of effective multi-phase parameters of bioturbated strata model.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study presents an integrated surface–subsurface workflow to enhance reservoir characterization in heterogeneous aeolian–fluvial systems. High-resolution surface analogs from the Iberian Desert comprising cross bedded aeolian dunes, interdune elements, bounding surfaces, and early calcite concretions, late silica cementation, were used to calibrate and validate subsurface interpretations based on core description, image logs, well logs, XRD, SEM, and thin section petrography. The analog informed framework allowed for the recognition of key architectural elements and diagenetic features that influence reservoir quality, including the spatial arrangement of facies, phreatic flow pathways, and cementation patterns. Subsurface data confirm that aeolian dune facies represent the highest quality reservoir intervals, with excellent porosity and permeability resulting from their well-sorted textures, low clay content, and limited early cementation. In contrast, interdune facies characterized by finer grains, higher clay content, and early-stage calcite and late stage silica cementation, act as lateral and vertical baffles, restricting flow continuity. Fluvial-dominated facies, concentrated in the central to southern part of the field, introduce localized heterogeneity and contribute to stratigraphic complexity and reservoir compartmentalization. A key finding of this study is the identification of early illite grain coatings, which inhibit quartz overgrowths and preserve…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Mixed aeolian-fluvial successions are known to form major hydrocarbon reservoirs in many places worldwide, often forming excellent reservoirs or pathways. However, heterogeneities inherent to these settings can pose significant challenges, requiring advanced reservoir characterization techniques. This study aims to investigate the impact of temporal and spatial variations on the preserved stratigraphic architecture of mixed aeolian-fluvial reservoirs resulting from morphological changes in depositional systems, leveraging insights from modern analogues, ancient outcrop, and subsurface datasets. This workflow involves investigating data from three primary sources: (i) analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery data from modern systems to examine geomorphological relationships and quantify the geometry, orientation, and morphology of depositional elements in both settings. (ii) conducting detailed observations of preserved successions from ancient outcrops, and (iii) describing and interpreting subsurface core and reservoir data. The results were integrated and validated against actual data to evaluate stratigraphic heterogeneity in subsurface reservoirs. Ultimately, multiple depositional models were constructed, explaining various reservoir quality and behavioral scenarios. This comprehensive integrative approach of modern, ancient and subsurface reservoir data revealed the intricate dynamics of interacting aeolian-fluvial systems.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Interacting fluvial, aeolian, and marine sedimentation processes typically yield complex, heterogeneous depositional sequences characterized by lateral and vertical variability. Consequently, precise stratigraphic correlations assume critical importance in predicting rock quality and connectivity, thus better characterization. However, correlating surfaces within deposits of terrestrial origin poses significant challenges. To address that, this study introduces a systematic approach on defining key stratigraphic bounding surfaces through integrating relationships among facies stacking patterns, correlative surfaces, and subsurface data. For the purpose of this study, more than 1000 ft. of core data were examined. Facies associations and major stratigraphic markers were defined, honoring regional sedimentology and stratigraphic understanding. Stratigraphic markers were then used as correlative surfaces to build frameworks across the field with the integration of wireline logs responses, facies stacking patterns, complemented by formation pressure data as validation tools for correlation and sub-unit divisions. Quality evaluation through the utilization of conventional core analysis and petrographic analysis also added to the study to have a comprehensive understanding about heterogeneity in relation with different stratigraphic sub-units and facies associations.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Hyperspectral sensor measured the reflected electromagnetic wave within visible, near, middle, and long-wave infrared intervals. In geology, Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) and Long-wave Infrared (LWIR) wavelength ranges have been proven to be useful to detect mineralogy variation of a material. The purest material is usually unable to be captured in many cases, especially in distance measurements such as airborne or satellite. Each measurement, a single pixel in an image or point, usually captures the spectra from the mixture of several minerals. Spectral unmixing is a method to estimate the abundance of constituent minerals and their distribution in the mixed material of an object being measured. Using endmembers retrieved from the purest endmember measured or spectral libraries, the relative composition (abundance) of every material is quantified by analyzing the influence of the endmember&apos;s spectra on the noisy/impure spectra of the given mixed material. In this project, the abundance of Calcite, Dolomite, and Quartz of rock powder samples from carbonate outcrops was quantified using several techniques, including linear, PLSR, and machine learning assisted hyperspectral unmixing methods, and the results were compared with other conventional determination methods. The powder samples are measured using a handheld hyperspectral measurement device, a spectroradiometer, that has a 2 cm measured surface.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Mississippi Valey Type (MVT) deposits are significant sources of lead and zinc, hosted in dolostone and limestone within platform carbonate sequences. These deposits are characterized by a lack of magmatic source, deriving metals from basinal brines. Carbonate-hosted ore deposits present exploration challenges due to limited mineralogical alteration halos. However, stable carbon and oxygen (C-O) isotopes in surrounding carbonates can reveal extensive alteration zones, potentially spanning for long distances, serving as indicators of ore body proximity. Studies have shown a connection between MVT deposits and petroleum systems, with some Pb-Zn deposits coexisting with oil and gas reservoirs, suggesting a genetic link between mineralization processes and hydrocarbon accumulation. This study explores the application of C-O isotope data as a mineral exploration tool within the geological framework of Saudi Arabia. The research focused on Miocene carbonates in the Mydian Terrane, which was chosen because they are similar in age to the Jabal Dhaylan deposit, the only recognized MVT deposit in Saudi Arabia. It&apos;s important to note that MVT deposits typically occur in clusters or belts, often containing multiple deposits. The methodology involved fieldwork, sampling, thin sections, multiple geochemical analyses using stable isotope mass spectrometry to obtain δ13C and δ18O values, QEMSCAN, XRD, and XRF. The main results from C-O isotope data reveal δ18O values ranging from -0…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces a novel method for enhancing drillbit tracking using passive seismic recordings. The method leverages surface passive seismic-while-drilling data, cross-correlated with pilot recordings from various locations along the drill string, to accurately focus, interpret, locate, and visualize drillbit positions. This approach offers an independent and precise estimation of well positions. The method interprets these images as probability distribution functions to simultaneously estimate locations and positional uncertainties. The proposed technique addresses the limitations of traditional well placement methods by providing high-resolution drillbit source images and continuous positional updates. This is particularly advantageous in complex geological settings where precise well placement is critical. The method&apos;s ability to deliver accurate drillbit locations without being confined to a spatial grid enhances its applicability across various drilling scenarios. Both synthetic and field data tests validate the method’s efficacy, demonstrating its robustness and reliability. The results indicate that this seismic-based approach can serve as a complementary technique to traditional magnetic and gyro Measurement While Drilling (MWD) technologies, potentially mitigating cumulative errors and improving overall well placement accuracy.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Accurate determination of near-surface velocity is essential for calculating static corrections for seismic data, as neglecting shallow velocity can lead to significant misplacement of deeper seismic reflectors. However, traditional methods for inverting refracted traveltimes data are often computationally intensive and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel machine learning-based inversion framework that predicts the thickness and velocity of near-surface layers from refracted traveltimes data. Our approach utilizes a data-driven methodology to approximate the relationship between seismic traveltimes and corresponding velocity and thickness, reducing ambiguities in seismic inversion results, particularly without sufficient prior information. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) model using synthetic traveltimes datasets and evaluated its performance on synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately estimate layer thicknesses and velocities with high consistency between predicted and actual values. Furthermore, applying the machine learning approach to a field dataset acquired over a dune in Saudi Arabia, comprising 37 receivers at 2 m intervals, yielded results consistent with borehole data. The proposed machine learning framework offers several advantages over traditional inversion techniques, including automatically identifying valuable inversion information without prior knowledge, avo…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study presents an enhanced reserve estimation approach that mitigates the limitations of conventional inversion methods, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making during exploration. The training process used acoustic impedance (AI) logs as the target variable and depth, two-way travel time, and seismic attributes at the well log scale as inputs. The models employed multilayer perceptrons, random forests, and extra tree regressions to predict the AI, which was then compared to the BLIMP (band-limited impedance inversion) data. The methodology emphasizes selecting suitable cutoffs or thresholds of porosity and permeability for optimal performance. Using cutoff values that match porosity and permeability extremes reduces error and improves reservoir parameter estimation for net pay. The hydrocarbon pore volume is subsequently computed, followed by the estimation of reserves and economic value. Compared with the available cited ground truth data (1.8310e+11 STB and 3.9549e+12 SAR), the ETR results in more accurate reserves and values (1.7174e+11 STB and 3.7096e+12 SAR). These results are also supported by the ETR&apos;s empirical value (a=0.1584) being closest to the value of the ground truth (a=0.1585). We conclude that, compared with the ground truth, the ML models exhibit varying performance, with the accurate trend of ETR &amp;amp;gt; RFR &amp;amp;gt; MLPR. In contrast, the values of the BLIMP are smaller than those of the ETR, provided that the threshold choices m…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract We present a physics-informed neural network approach for full-waveform inversion (FWI) that embeds a Deep Image Prior (DIP) U-Net within the inversion loop and applies explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret the learned model. Starting from a decimated Marmousi velocity model, we generate synthetic seismic data via 2D acoustic wave propagation. A smoothed version of the true model initializes a randomly initialized U-Net (the DIP), which is pretrained to replicate the smoothed model. Thereafter, the DIP&apos;s weights replace the cell-wise velocity parameters in FWI, and an iterative optimizer adjusts these weights to minimize discrepancies between observed and simulated waveforms. The resulting high-resolution velocity model arises from physics-constrained learning. To reveal the network&apos;s decision process, we compute attribution maps using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Integrated Gradients, and occlusion sensitivity. These maps highlight the spatial features; primarily high-contrast layers and anomalies that drive the DIP&apos;s output. Comparative analyses of true vs. predicted models, residuals, and combined depth/lateral sensitivity profiles confirm that the deep model captures essential subsurface structures. This framework enhances transparency in seismic inversion by linking data-driven models to geophysical knowledge, thus bridging the gap between &quot;black-box&quot; deep learning and interpretable imaging.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract In line with Saudi Arabia&apos;s commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, the country is actively exploring its geothermal potential, with most planned initiatives focusing on the pre-rift basement formations and geothermal provinces of the Arabian Shield. However, one of the limitations of targeting basement rocks is that they tend to have very low permeabilities, in many cases requiring to implement hydraulic fracturing to enhance connectivity. This work aims to evaluate the potential of producing geothermal energy from porous syn-rift basins’ sediments through reservoir static and dynamic modeling. The methodology involves constructing a representative 3D geological model of the Al-Wajh Formation, utilizing basin and well data, along with information from analogous geological Formations. The workflow incorporates seismic data, well-logs, structural maps, and petrophysical data to create a 3D representation of the geological Formation. A methodology is introduced here to estimate porosity reduction caused by compaction for the deepest parts of the basins where temperatures tend to increase and where, in many cases, no data is available, allowing to estimate the potential production rates for these high temperature and low permeability zones. By integrating this model with numerical simulations, we provide an understanding of the potential rates and temperatures achievable in these types of basins together with the potential thermal power and electric power that c…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study investigates Middle Miocene carbonate platform outcrops along the Arabian margin of the Red Sea. These platforms, formed on footwalls of major rift faults, serve as analogues for fault-block carbonate reservoirs. The study focuses on platform geometry, facies distribution, and diagenetic features, which are relevant for exploration models and reservoir characterization. The study integrates field observations, satellite imagery, and stratigraphic analysis across an 800 km stretch of coastline. The platforms are dated to the Late Burdigalian to Early Langhian (16-14 Ma) and rest unconformably on Precambrian basement and syn-rift sedimentary rocks. Structural control results in elongated fringing platform geometries aligned with fault scarps of normal faults. Fore-reef coral-algal rudstone facies are well preserved, whereas back-reef deposits are preserved only in some locations. Diagenetic alterations include marine cementation, meteoric dissolution, dolomitization, and localized Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) mineralization with Zn, Pb, Cu sulfides, barite, and Mn oxides. These features reflect multiple diagenetic stages and variable fluid histories. The platforms exhibit consistent structural and sedimentological patterns along the margin, highlighting the influence of tectonic setting on carbonate development. The results support the application of these outcrops as analogues for subsurface systems in rift-related carbonate plays.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

This study investigates a 30-meter-wide deformation outcrop within the Dammam Dome, Eastern Saudi Arabia, using 2D and 3D seismic tomography techniques complemented by detailed mineralogical analysis. The 2D seismic refraction survey was conducted along a 360-meter profile using a cabled geophone system, while the 3D survey employed a wireless nodal array comprising 108 receivers and 385 shot points. The receivers were deployed along six in-line profiles with 8-meter spacing in both in-line and cross-line directions, and sources were distributed along 11 profiles with 4-meter offsets. Super-virtual refraction interferometry (SVI) was applied to both datasets to enhance signal-to-noise ratios and improve the continuity of first-arrival traveltimes in the challenging field environment. The resulting 2D tomograms revealed a prominent high-velocity anomaly ranging from 1210 to 1650 m/s within the upper 20 meters of the subsurface. A comparable deformation zone was observed in the 3D model, with velocities ranging from 650 to 800 m/s, delineating lateral and vertical heterogeneities consistent with structural deformation.

This study investigates the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Type II-S marine source rocks of Jordan (JSR) to examine organic and inorganic compositional variability corresponding to paleoenvironmental conditions during deposition. The identification of distinct geochemical cycles in these source rocks contributes to a deeper understanding of the depositional settings and paleoenvironmental dynamics influencing organic matter distribution. The study utilized a comprehensive analytical approach, including Spectral Gamma Ray (SGR), RockEval pyrolysis, XRD, XRF, ICP, SEM-EDX, and petrographic examination.

This study aims to examine the characteristics of natural fractures within unconventional hydrocarbon source rocks from the Eastern Mediterranean, focusing on their stratigraphic distribution, timing, and formation mechanisms. Understanding these factors is vital for the broader context of hydrocarbon exploration and resource management on a global scale. This research employs a multi-faceted approach, integrating core samples, and geochemical data to analyze natural fractures in organic-rich Upper Cretaceous source rocks, specifically in Jordan, which has relevance to similar geological settings worldwide.

The primary objective was to develop a rapid, efficient, cost-effective, and non-destructive method for analyzing mudstone cores. This goal was achieved by combining and analyzing representative elements from each group, including Ca (carbonate-associated element), Si, Al, Fe, Ti, K (terrigenous-associated elements), and Mo, Ni, V, and Cu (redox-sensitive trace elements). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) were utilized to identify chemofacies and establish chronostratigraphic subdivisions, subsequently facilitating correlations between different wells. Each dataset has a generated several clusters, and their validity has been confirmed by comparing them with core samples and measurements. This process led to the selection of the most appropriate cluster/chemofacies. Each cluster/chemofacies represents a major lithofacies defined by its chemical composition. Five rock classes/chemofacies based on elemental compositions have been identified in this study, including chalk/limestone, marly limestone, organic-rich mudstone, sandstone, and mixed mudstone. Additionally, through the integration of core measurements and chemostratigraphy, multiple stratigraphic zones have been iden…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The geomechanical properties of rocks are crucial for understanding reservoir behavior and variations in quality, particularly in complex carbonate systems. While various approaches, such as well logs and seismic data, have been employed to characterize these properties in carbonate formations, achieving accurate results from these proxies remains challenging. The Middle Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation (TMF) in Saudi Arabia is of significant importance for both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon exploration. However, limited research exists on the influence of depositional facies on the geomechanical properties of the TMF and the resulting implications for reservoir quality and heterogeneity. Thus, this study examines the rock mechanical behavior, geochemical composition, petrophysical properties,lithofacies and their interrelationships within the TMF. In the study area, TMF consists of three principal depositional facies, which are bioclastic Wackstone, peloidal grainstoneand bioclastic-peloidal packstone. The maximum and minimum average values for uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), compressional and shear wave velocities measured were 148MPa and 34MPa; 5924m/s and 3307m/s; 3135m/s and 1861m/s, respectively. The average porosity values obtained are ranging from a minimum of 2.3% to a maximum of 19.2%. The highest value of the UCS were recorded from the bioclastic wackstone depositional facies with relatively high organic matter content and the peloidal grainsto…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Silica diagenesis plays a critical yet understudied role in modifying the hydrocarbon potential of organic-rich carbonate source rocks. This review systematically examines how silica transformations—from biogenic opal to quartz—fundamentally alter rock properties through three key mechanisms: First, mineralogical reorganization, where silica dissolution creates secondary porosity while cementation occludes pore throats, directly impacting fluid flow pathways. Second, geochemical feedbacks, including pH-driven carbonate dissolution and catalytic effects on organic matter maturation that influence hydrocarbon generation kinetics. Third, pore network evolution, where silica-induced microfractures provide migration conduits but heterogeneous cementation can trap hydrocarbons. The synthesis highlights three novel insights: (1) The timing of silica diagenesis relative to hydrocarbon generation determines whether pores remain open for migration or become sealed; (2) Microscale silica-carbonate interactions control reservoir quality more significantly than previously recognized; and (3) Modern analytical techniques reveal complex diagenetic histories that challenge traditional models. By integrating petrographic, geochemical, and petrophysical evidence, this work establishes a predictive framework for evaluating how silica diagenesis impacts petroleum systems, from source rock maturation to trap integrity. The findings are particularly relevant for unconventional carbonate reservoirs…&#10;Topics: Diagenesis, Geology, Carbonate, Geochemistry, Carbonate rock&#10;Venue: Frontiers in Earth Science&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 2</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is increasingly used for vertical seismic profiling (VSP) due to its high spatial sampling density and reduced costs relative to conventional geophone-based methods. This paper presents a large-scale dual-well DAS VSP survey and a comprehensive workflow for data conditioning and early-arrival full-waveform inversion (FWI) implemented using the deep learning (DL) framework PyTorch. Two adjacent wells, 4 km deep and 1.5 km apart, were instrumented with fiber on tubing. Dense land acquisition spanning 4.5 km along the line connecting the wells features a single dual-fiber interrogator and high levels of noise driven by the arid environment. We present a fully automated workflow that allows processing of such data introducing zero-offset supergather that is kinematically inverted for initial model building and synthetic-driven muting strategy to mitigate the effect of the noise. We also introduce pressure to strain-acceleration transform to accommodate DAS simulations using an acoustic solver and source function centroid constraints to adaptively update the source function throughout the iterations while preserving the source timing. Our results confirm the feasibility of combining DAS data and a DL framework for high-resolution velocity inversion in a desert environment with fiber deployed on tubing.&#10;Topics: Geology, Dual (grammatical number), Philosophy, Linguistics&#10;Venue: The Leading Edge&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Sabkha environments are a prevalent topographic feature in arid coastal areas. Along the Arabian Gulf, sabkhas overlie substantial hydrocarbon reservoirs and exhibit intricate lithological characteristics and an extremely shallow water table. These factors contribute to elevated seismic velocities and signal distortion. Static correction, a crucial initial step in seismic reflection processing, is employed to mitigate the impact of shallow surface layers. In this study, we investigate the variations in seismic properties along the uppermost part of mature and developing sabkhas. We employed high‐resolution seismic experiments with geophone spacing of 10 cm to explore the upper tens of centimeters. Conventional surveys with a 2 m spacing complement this approach to investigate deeper layers. Both sabkhas exhibit a unique characteristic of a partially saturated zone, which affects the seismic velocity, leading to lower velocities and consequently influencing the accuracy of the static correction. The high‐resolution surveys demonstrated superior accuracy to conventional approaches in determining the top of the partial saturation zone and hardground layer, hence resulting in a more reliable velocity delineation. Moreover, velocities derived from conventional, replacement, and tomogram approaches resulted in unreliable static corrections in mature coastal sabkha compared with developing inland sabkha, attributed to the considerable geological complexity that is character…&#10;Topics: Geology, Seismology, Geophysics, Oceanography&#10;Venue: Earth and Space Science&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis of zeolite from kaolinite-rich saprolite from Al-Habala Area, Saudi Arabia, providing insights on kaolinite as an economically viable precursor for zeolite formation. This study was conducted using hydrothermal rectors with a 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution at temperatures of 150 °C, 200 °C, and 250 °C over a duration of 336 h. At 150 °C, the dissolution of the clay and feldspar grains began, forming amorphous silica, from which mordenite rods formed. Increased temperatures promoted the formation of cubic analcime crystals at 200 °C to well-developed trapezohedron aggregates at 250 °C. The mineralogical transformations were characterized using SEM, XRD, and ICP-OES analyses, revealing the role of temperature on the morphologies, compositional alteration, and decreasing Na concentrations correlating with the formation of analcime. The newly formed analcime closely matched the composition of natural analcime from different basins. The results confirm that saprolite can effectively serve as a medium for zeolite synthesis, highlighting its potential for cost-effective industrial applications and expanding the understanding of kaolinite-to-zeolite conversion pathways.&#10;Topics: Saprolite, Kaolinite, Geochemistry, Transformation (genetics), Geology&#10;Venue: Minerals&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The population of Africa is growing at a rate of over 2.3% per year, the highest rate of growth among the continents, and it contained the world&apos;s 20 fastest-growing economies in 2024. Its economy is partly driven by its large resources of minerals, oil and diamonds, and its rapidly growing population. Geoscience research, knowledge and application will be vital for the sustainable use of these resources. A bibliometric analysis from 2014 to 2024 reveals that Africa is under-represented in elements of geoscience research for the energy transition (carbon capture and storage, critical minerals, geothermal), as well as in advanced data science, for example machine learning and artificial intelligence, both of which are likely to form a part of the geoscience solutions to energy transition challenges. This representation is shown in terms of the small number of papers published on Africa, and more crucially those on Africa that are led by Africa-based researchers. The situation could be improved by provision of competitive salaries for African academics, as well as encouraging foreign researchers to develop collaborators in Africa, including building more sustainability and less dependency into African research funding. Aid ‘paternalism’ can be counteracted by schemes that encourage local agency, and capacity building in Africa.&#10;Topics: Earth science, Energy (signal processing), Transition (genetics), Geography, Geology&#10;Venue: Geoenergy&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>
